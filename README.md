[Starseed Pilgrim](https://starseedpilgrim.com) is a game that involves growing colourful, tree-like structures in unpredictable ways. Fun and highly recommended!

You can only see a small area of the world at any given time, and after a while I wanted to see the big picture. Being a small game, there wasn't any existing utility that I could find for this, so I wrote my own. Required a bit of reverse engineering of the save file, and yielded some pretty little maps of the coloured blocks I grew over the course of my game.

Also helped me cheat, of course. Spoiler alert: maybe look at the maps *after* you've played the game!
